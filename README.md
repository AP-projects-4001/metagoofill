# metagoofill
The "Store" project of "metagoofill" group

Program structure:
In this program, the goal of the creators is to set up a store. In this program, sellers can register their goods and sell them through the program platform.
Buyers can also achieve their needs very quickly by comparing goods and filtering goods based on personal needs.
 
At the top of the program, An administrator is defined who can access all the information of sellers and buyers and even remove offending users from the system for a while :)
Admin account username and password are selected by Admin programmers and can be changed by programmers.
----
The software is created by creator (qt) and contains 3 headers, source, and form.
The program is compiled by the compiler and then executed.
We got a lot of help from mingw64 in this work.
To run the program, you need a creator (same as qt) or an installation file.
There is an installation file installed in this project.




And now you can use this program in any graphical embedded system with run following command :

docker pull yaghooli/yaghooli:latest
